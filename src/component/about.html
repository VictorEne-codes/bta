                Bishop Thomas Olayiwola Aremu grew up with values that would define his extraordinary journey, hard
                work, faith, and an unwavering commitment to his divine calling. As a young man, Thomas pursued a career
                in accounting, demonstrating remarkable skill and diligence. By 1984, at just 27, he became a Chartered
                Accountant. A significant achievement. But beyond professional success, what set him apart was his
                unshakable faith. He believed God was guiding his steps, and this trust propelled his rapid rise in the
                civil service. Within just 18 months, he advanced from Grade Level-8 to Grade Level-12, gaining
                 recognition for both his competence and integrity.</p>

            <p class="text-white text-[18px] md:text-[24px] text-justify">In 1986, a life-changing moment occurred when
                Bishop David Oyedepo visited Thomas’s home in Sokoto. At the time, Thomas and his wife were believing
                God for a child. During the visit, Bishop Oyedepo prophetically declared that their waiting was over.
                That very month, his wife conceived their first daughter, Faith, an undeniable testament to God’s power.
                Three years later, in 1989, another prophetic word came during a pastors’ gathering. Bishop Oyedepo
                lifted Thomas’s wife’s hands and declared that she would conceive twins. True to the declaration, the
                couple welcomed a boy and a girl that same year.</p>

                True to the prophetic word, the couple welcomed a boy and a girl that same year. Today, their three
                children have grown to be successful professionals, a reflection of the power of God’s word. It wasn’t
                just personal blessings that marked Thomas Aremu’s life; he also experienced God’s provision in his
                material life. While working on the Dominion Cathedral in Kaduna in 1989, Bishop Oyedepo declared that
                all connected to the project would build their own houses. By 1990, Thomas completed his first house, a
                testament to both his hard work and God’s faithfulness. In 1994, Thomas made the</p>

                another proof of God’s provision. Then came the pivotal moment of surrender. In 1994, he answered the
                call to full-time ministry. That May, Bishop Oyedepo confirmed God’s instruction to plant a new church
                in Ibadan. On June 5, 1994, with just 23 people in attendance, the Ibadan Church was born. What followed
                was nothing short of a revival. By 1998, membership had surged past 10,000, and the impact extended
                beyond Ibadan into neighboring states.</p>

                several cities, each time leaving behind a trail of unprecedented growth: Ilorin (1998–2004): Membership
                grew from 4,000 to 17,000. Kaduna (2004–2007): The congregation expanded from 20,000 to 27,000. In 2008,
                he embraced an international mandate, serving as Regional Overseer for South Africa and ten other
                countries. Under his leadership in Johannesburg, the church doubled in size within a year, and 12 new
                churches were planted across South Africa. His impact extended even further when he was appointed Vice
                President, Africa, and later Vice President of Foreign Missions, overseeing global church expansion.</p>
